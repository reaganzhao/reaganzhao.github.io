Ranking problems are the pivot of many machine learning applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, and personalized content delivery. Deep Cross Networks (DCN)—a state-of-the-art approach designed to tackle ranking problems with precision and scalability. Unlike traditional models like linear regression or generalized matrix factorization, which may struggle to capture intricate feature relationships, DCN is particularly good at learning both explicit and implicit interactions between features. It combines the power of deep learning with a cross-layer mechanism, allowing for efficient learning without high computational complexity.


**1.Feature Interaction Learning**

Ranking tasks often involve high-dimensional and sparse data from different sources — think user demographics, historical behavior, item characteristics, and contextual signals. DCN captures both explicit feature interactions (e.g., cross-products of features like user_age * item_price) and implicit interactions through cross layers. Below is a python code example of a common cross layer:

```python
class CrossLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, num_cross_layers):
        super(CrossLayer, self).__init__()
        self.num_cross_layers = num_cross_layers
        self.cross_weights = []
        self.cross_biases = []

    def build(self, input_shape):
        for _ in range(self.num_cross_layers):
            self.cross_weights.append(self.add_weight(
                shape=(input_shape[-1], 1), initializer='glorot_uniform', trainable=True))
            self.cross_biases.append(self.add_weight(
                shape=(input_shape[-1],), initializer='zeros', trainable=True))

    def call(self, inputs):
        x0 = inputs
        x = inputs
        for i in range(self.num_cross_layers):
            # x_l+1 = x0 * (W * x_l) + b + x_l
            x = tf.matmul(x0, tf.matmul(x, self.cross_weights[i])) + self.cross_biases[i] + x
        return x```
 
In the above example, cross_weights represents the contribution of each feature to the other features. The weights will be updated and adjusted for each layer. cross_biases are used to offset the interactions captured by the cross weights. They allow the model to fine-tune feature interactions by adding a constant adjustment to each dimension. Later, you will call the build function with all your features as below:

```python
search_keywords = Input(shape=(10,), name='search_keywords'))
user_prev_orders = Input(shape=(1,), name='user_prev_orders')
restaurant_features = Input(shape=(5,), name='restaurant_features')

# Feature Embeddings (if needed)
search_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=1000, output_dim=8, input_length=10)(search_keywords)  # Embedding for keywords
search_embedding = Flatten()(search_embedding)

# Combine All Features
combined_features = Concatenate()([search_embedding, user_prev_orders, restaurant_features])
cross_layer = CrossLayer(num_cross_layers=3)(combined_features)
```
       
The model will be created under model registry in the sagemaker resources.
